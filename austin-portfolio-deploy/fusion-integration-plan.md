# Blaze Intelligence Fusion Integration Plan

## Overview
Fusing capabilities from:
1. **https://blaze-intelligence.replit.app/** - Main production platform
2. **https://de560bcf-ce8e-4673-b0b5-32fae33216bb.spock.prod.repl.run/** - Advanced analytics UI
3. **Local Blaze-Intelligence.zip** - Enhanced backend services

## Architecture Components to Integrate

### From Replit App #1 (blaze-intelligence.replit.app)
- Multi-AI orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)
- Stripe payment processing integration
- Advanced sports data services (MLB, NFL, NBA, CFB)
- Video analysis engine with AI coaching
- WebSocket real-time data streaming
- Production-grade logging and monitoring
- Authentication and subscription management

### From Replit App #2 (Spock deployment)
- Three.js dynamic background visualization
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) pressure stream
- WebGL shader dynamic gradients
- Canvas-based real-time win probability tracking
- Advanced UI animations and interactions

### From Local Zip Archive
- Enhanced backend infrastructure
- Advanced caching with Redis
- Production monitoring dashboard
- Backup systems
- Digital combine backend
- Cardinals real-data integration

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Services Migration
1. **AI Services Integration**
   - Copy multi-AI orchestration from Replit server.js
   - Integrate OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini APIs
   - Port video analysis engine capabilities

2. **Data Pipeline Enhancement**
   - Merge SportsDataService with existing data providers
   - Integrate ballDontLie NBA service
   - Add Cardinals real-data integration

3. **WebSocket Enhancement**
   - Upgrade current WebSocket to SportsWebSocketServer
   - Add Server-Sent Events for pressure streams
   - Implement real-time win probability tracking

### Phase 2: UI/UX Fusion
1. **Visual Components**
   - Port Three.js dynamic backgrounds
   - Integrate WebGL shader effects
   - Add canvas-based pressure stream visualization
   - Enhance hero section with dynamic gradients

2. **Interactive Features**
   - Add win probability tracking UI
   - Implement event marker rendering
   - Enhance real-time data visualizations

### Phase 3: Production Features
1. **Authentication & Payments**
   - Integrate Stripe subscription system
   - Add JWT authentication middleware
   - Implement subscription-based access control

2. **Monitoring & Performance**
   - Add production logging with Winston
   - Implement Redis caching layer
   - Set up monitoring dashboard
   - Configure backup systems

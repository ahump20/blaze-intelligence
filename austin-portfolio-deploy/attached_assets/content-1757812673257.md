### Built for Winners

Founded by Austin Humphrey

Blaze Intelligence was born from a simple observation: the best coaches and scouts
have an intuitive sense for talent that goes beyond traditional statistics.
We built Blaze to quantify those intangibles - to turn gut feelings into data-driven decisions.


"We're not just tracking what happened. We're predicting what will happen.
That's the difference between playing the game and changing it."


## Ready to Transform Your Game?

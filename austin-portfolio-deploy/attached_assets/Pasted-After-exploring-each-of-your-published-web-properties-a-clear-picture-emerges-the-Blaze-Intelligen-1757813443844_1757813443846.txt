After exploring each of your published web properties, a clear picture emerges: the Blaze Intelligence ecosystem contains many overlapping pages and experimental concepts, but lacks a single unified narrative and consistent product presentation.  Below is a synthesis of the most consequential observations and practical next steps.

What exists today
	•	Core marketing site (a8c4d1…, 70d41e32…) – Both domains present similar hero messaging (“Transform data into championships”) and claim 94.6% prediction accuracy and sub‑100ms response times ￼ ￼.  They include calls‑to‑action to view a live dashboard or read a manifesto.  A dashboard page shows fictitious ESPN/Stats API connections and an AI control panel, but the metrics are placeholder values.
	•	Command Center & Coach prototype – The /coach and /command center routes showcase a neural analysis engine, with widgets for confidence score, posture quality, micro‑expression recognition and voice analysis ￼.  These pages demonstrate UI ideas but currently use zeroed‑out values and no real data.
	•	Expanded “Deep South Sports Authority” pages – Several domains (76c9e5b9…, blaze-intelligence.netlify.app, blaze‑3d.netlify.app, blaze-intelligence‑main.netlify.app) introduce an “AI Consciousness Engine” with 25 neurons and 15 synapses and a 3D NIL dashboard that tracks SEC NIL values, transfer portal predictions and readiness scores ￼ ￼.  The classic view shows tables of top‑10 NIL programs and includes claims such as “SEC commands 40% of all FBS NIL spending” ￼.
	•	FBS coverage integration & statistics dashboards – These pages display readiness boards for the St. Louis Cardinals and a live player matrix (Goldschmidt, Arenado, Contreras) using Baseball Savant/FanGraphs data ￼.  There are also sections for recent game outcomes and blog‑style updates on college football and NFL analysis ￼.
	•	About/Video pages – The video‑showcase site focuses on your personal journey from athlete to analytics architect, emphasising your playing background and presenting recommended videos to share with stakeholders ￼.  This personal story is compelling and gives credibility to the platform.
	•	3D game & AR concept – One domain highlights a “Championship 3D Baseball Engine” with live stats, analytics and win probability ￼.  It teases realistic physics and interactive game simulations, but again the values are placeholders.

Key issues identified
	•	Fragmentation and redundancy: Many pages repeat similar taglines, metrics and features with slight variations.  Users land on different domains that feel disconnected or experimental.
	•	Credibility gaps: Claims like 94.6% prediction accuracy, “AI consciousness” with neurons/synapses, and 2.8M+ data points appear without context or evidence ￼.  Over‑the‑top language (“neural sensitivity”, “character/grit”) risks undermining trust unless backed by demonstrable models.
	•	Unclear product differentiation: It’s not obvious which features are production‑ready versus prototypes.  The dashboards and NIL calculators display static or zero values, suggesting mock‑ups rather than live analytics.
	•	Mixed branding: Some pages are branded “Blaze Intelligence,” others “Deep South Sports Authority,” creating confusion about the company identity.

Suggested next steps
	1.	Consolidate domains and messaging
Adopt a single primary domain (e.g., blaze-intelligence.com) with clearly delineated sections for product features, case studies, and about/vision.  Archive or redirect experimental subdomains to avoid user confusion.  Use consistent branding and style across pages.
	2.	Focus on demonstrable core products
Decide which modules are ready for market (e.g., real‑time player/team dashboards, NIL valuation tool, video biomechanics analysis) and highlight those.  Remove or clearly label conceptual elements like “AI consciousness neurons” unless there is a tangible underlying model.  Provide sample outputs or case studies with real data to improve credibility.
	3.	Enhance data integrity and transparency
If you present metrics (e.g., 94.6% prediction accuracy, NIL values), include methodology summaries or footnotes.  Use cited data sources such as MLB Statcast and FanGraphs, as shown on the FBS integration pages ￼.  This builds trust with analytics‑savvy users.
	4.	Unify dashboards and analytics
The readiness boards, live player matrices and game analytics are compelling.  Integrate them into a single interactive dashboard with filters for Cardinals, Titans, Longhorns, Grizzlies, and potential future teams.  Use real‑time data feeds (e.g., MLB Stats API, NCAA, NFL) and allow users to drill down into metrics.
	5.	Prioritise sports coverage expansion
As noted in your “Prime Tasks” list, broadening beyond the current four teams will increase value.  Add additional MLB/NFL/NCAA teams and high‑school programs, and incorporate NIL valuation models that account for micro‑expressions, character assessment and social‑media reach.
	6.	Develop the video intelligence platform
The micro‑expression and biomechanics coach concept is innovative but presently not functional.  Start by integrating existing pose‑estimation libraries to generate basic biomechanics reports and build from there.  Once working, showcase these capabilities with sample videos on the about/video page.
	7.	Clarify business model and ROI
Create a dedicated pricing/ROI page with a calculator that compares Blaze Intelligence to manual scouting or competing analytics platforms.  Offer clear tiers (Starter, Pro, Enterprise) like those hinted on the Deep South Sports Authority site ￼, and tie ROI to measurable performance outcomes.
	8.	Leverage your story strategically
Keep the “Meet your analytics partner” narrative and integrate it into the main site’s “About” section.  Share your athletic credentials, mission and values (data‑driven, integrity) while connecting them to product capabilities ￼.
	9.	Consider accessibility and design polish
Maintain the dark‑theme aesthetic but ensure readability (e.g., increase contrast on small text) and performance (reduce heavy animations).  Provide alt‑text for images and ensure mobile responsiveness.

By consolidating the sprawling set of pages into a cohesive product experience and grounding your claims in verifiable data, Blaze Intelligence can move from prototype to credible sports analytics platform.

  <p class="p">This report explores the integrated sports ecosystem of the Deep Southâ€”from Perfect Game youth baseball and Pop&nbsp;Warner football to SEC dominance and professional pipelines. Below is a condensed overview; download the full report for detailed tables and citations.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">Youth</h2>
  <p class="p">Perfect Game Youth's inviteâ€‘only showcases and tournaments provide dataâ€‘driven evaluations for players aged&nbsp;11â€“14; the South's youth scene is highly competitive. In youth football, Pop&nbsp;Warner leagues and 7â€‘onâ€‘7 circuits feed powerhouse high schools, with early use of Hudl film and wearable tech.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">High School</h2>
  <p class="p">Texas powerhouses like Duncanville, North&nbsp;Shore and Southlake&nbsp;Carroll, along with Georgia's Grayson and Buford, dominate football recruiting. Elite baseball programs (Flower&nbsp;Mound, Pearland, Johnson) produce Division&nbsp;I talent, while travel organizations such as the South Texas Sliders, Banditos Baseball Club, Dulinâ€™s Dodgers and Wings Baseball boast hundreds of college commitments.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">College</h2>
  <p class="p">Half the SEC football teams started 2â€“0 in 2025; key Week&nbsp;3 matchups include Georgia vs. Tennessee and Arkansas vs. Ole&nbsp;Miss. Final 2025 SEC baseball standings were led by Texas&nbsp;(23â€“7), Arkansas&nbsp;(20â€“10) and LSU&nbsp;(19â€“11). NIL collectives provide funding that effectively covers full scholarships and elevate quarterback valuations into the millions.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">Professional &amp; Media</h2>
  <p class="p">Deep South MLB and NFL franchises draw heavily from SEC and highâ€‘school pipelines. The media landscape is fragmented across SEC Network, ESPN+, Texan&nbsp;Live, NFHS Network, PG.TV and regional sports networksâ€”highlighting the need for an integrated analytics and streaming platform.</p>

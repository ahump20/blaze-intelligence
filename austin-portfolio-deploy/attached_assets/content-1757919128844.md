include


string


false


includeincludeavailableunlisted

This parameter indicates which `BettingOutcome` records to return in the payload. By default, this endpoint only returns available outcomes, excluding the unlisted bets.

**Important Note:** the default parameter of `available` is much faster and provides the best performance. Passing unlisted will return unlisted odds, but these are cached for much longer and may be several minutes old. For best performance, the default parameter is highly recommended.

Possible values include:

`available` \- excludes any betting outcomes that have been removed/unlisted by the respective sportsbook. This is more lightweight and delivers odds much faster than using unlisted.

`unlisted` \- includes the most recently available betting outcome per sportsbook, for each listed market, even those outcomes are expired/unlisted or otherwise unavailable from the respective sportsbook. This is a far heavier payload, and it's cached for much longer than available.

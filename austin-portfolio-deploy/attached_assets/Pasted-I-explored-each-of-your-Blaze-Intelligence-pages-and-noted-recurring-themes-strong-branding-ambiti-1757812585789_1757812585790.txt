I explored each of your Blaze Intelligence pages and noted recurring themes: strong branding, ambitious feature sets (AI consciousness, NIL calculators, digital combines, 3D analytics), and a heavy emphasis on Texas‑centric sports. However, many of these pages are either static prototypes or contain placeholders. Here are concrete next steps to move the platform from concept to functional product:
	•	Build the unfinished Vision‑AI modules.  On the main “Next‑Gen Sports Analytics Platform” page the Vision AI engine shows dashes for “Biomechanics,” “Micro‑Expression” and “Character/Grit” ￼.  Likewise, the Neural Coach page lists every emotion at 0 % and pitch at “0 Hz” ￼.  Implement the actual computer‑vision and voice‑analysis pipelines (e.g. pose‑tracking, micro‑expression classifiers, pitch/timbre analysis) so these dashboards display real measurements instead of placeholders.
	•	Replace projection placeholders with live data.  The FBS integration/Statistics Dashboard warns that the platform is still in development and that “all metrics shown are projections or development targets” ￼.  Several metrics (Champion Readiness, Cognitive Leverage, Prescriptive Scouting Score, Champion Enigma Factor) are shown as “–” ￼.  As the data pipelines come online, remove the “Development Phase” banner, feed real stats (e.g. MLB Statcast, NFL Next Gen Stats, college tracking data) into these widgets, and ensure the readiness boards and cognitive metrics update automatically.
	•	Unify and streamline the user experience.  There are at least five distinct marketing sites and dashboards (Netlify, 3D Universe, Deep South Authority, LSL coverage, etc.), each with its own navigation.  Consolidate these into a single portal with a consistent design system, navigation structure and brand voice.  Include one login for all features (analytics dashboard, video analysis, NIL calculator, 3D universe) rather than scattering them across subdomains.
	•	Finish the ROI calculators and contact forms.  Several pages invite the user to “Calculate ROI” or “Send Message,” but there is no evidence that the inputs drive any computation.  Build a back‑end service that accepts team size, games per season and current costs, computes Blaze’s projected savings, and returns a report.  Likewise, ensure that “Schedule Demo” and “Start Your Project” forms actually send data to a CRM.
	•	Enhance the NIL and 3D analytics modules.  The 3D Universe site tracks $196 M+ SEC NIL values and lists Texas at $22 M with Arch Manning valued at $6.8 M ￼.  Turn this from a static list into an interactive dashboard where users can click on a program to see athlete‑by‑athlete breakdowns, YoY growth, transfer‑portal movement and social‑media multipliers ￼.  Integrate NIL insights throughout the analytics suite, including the ROI calculator.
	•	Broaden team and sport coverage.  Most demo content revolves around the Cardinals, Titans, Longhorns and Grizzlies.  To appeal to a wider market, add support for other MLB, NFL, NBA and NCAA teams.  The site already claims the ability to handle “50+ programs” and an “average top‑10 program value of $16.57 M” ￼; the analytics backend should reflect this breadth.
	•	Create data stories and case studies.  The Deep South Authority page positions the platform as capable of “real‑time narrative generation” and “championship modeling” ￼.  Produce example case studies or interactive data stories demonstrating how the platform predicted an upset, improved player development, or saved a program money.  These tangible examples will build credibility with prospective clients.
	•	Integrate the video showcase across the platform.  The Video Showcase page explains Austin Humphrey’s background and offers three demo videos (story, overview, live demo).  Embed these videos into the main site and dashboards so visitors don’t need to switch contexts to learn about the founder and the technology.
	•	Invest in backend infrastructure and APIs.  Many pages tout “<100 ms latency,” “33‑point biomechanical tracking,” and “real‑time WebSocket streaming,” yet there is no visible API documentation.  Publish a developer portal with documentation for the Blaze API (analytics, vision, predictions) similar to the pseudo‑code shown on the main dashboard page ￼.  This will enable third‑party integrations and validate your technical claims.

Focusing on these areas will turn Blaze Intelligence from a compelling prototype into a robust, data‑driven platform capable of delivering on its promise of championship‑level insights.

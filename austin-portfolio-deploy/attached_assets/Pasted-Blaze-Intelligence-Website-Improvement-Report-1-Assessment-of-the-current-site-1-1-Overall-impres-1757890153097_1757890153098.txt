Blaze Intelligence Website Improvement Report

1. Assessment of the current site

1.1 Overall impression

The current site at blaze‑intelligence.netlify.app is an early prototype rather than a production‑ready dashboard.  The landing page is visually striking with a dark background, orange/green accents and particle animations.  It advertises a “Sub‑100ms Multimodal Analytics for Elite Sports Performance” message and lists key metrics such as response time (<100 ms) and accuracy (94.6 %) ￼, which creates a feeling of high‑performance analytics.  However, most of the menu items lead to pages that only contain a header and a “Return to Home” link, with no functional content.  The only section with significant content is the Executive Intelligence Center under Platform → Executive Intelligence.

1.2 Navigation and content
	•	Navigation structure:  The main navigation bar includes dropdown menus for Platform, Analytics, Sports and Resources plus Login and Get Started buttons.  The drop‑downs are properly styled, but there is a disconnect between the number of links and the actual pages implemented.  For example, selecting RTI Dashboard, Sports Intelligence, NIL Calculator, SEC Analytics, Performance Monitor, SEC Football, Championship AI, Digital Combine, Deep South Authority, Pricing, ROI Calculator, Contact Us, Request Demo and Login all bring the user to minimal pages showing only a title and some placeholder text ￼ ￼.  There are no forms, charts or data on these pages.
	•	Executive Intelligence Center:  The page /executive‑intelligence‑center contains the majority of the site’s functionality.  It displays high‑level metrics such as platform accuracy (94.6 %), active athletes (2 847), data points analyzed (2.8 M+), response time (<100 ms) and cost savings (67 %) ￼.  It also presents a real‑time intelligence feed with insights (e.g., “Velocity trending up 2.3 mph in 8th inning” ￼) and a championship analytics dashboard with metrics like Cardinals win probability (78.4 %), Titans playoff chances (62.1 %) and SEC performance index (91.2) ￼.  However, other sections such as the 3D Performance Visualization and Championship Probability Model show only empty containers without interactive charts.
	•	Broken or missing functionality:  Many links point to pages that have not been built, and the Login and Get Started buttons do not present any login form or registration workflow.  The lack of forms means users cannot request a demo or sign up for services.  Buttons such as Refresh Data and Export Report appear on the executive dashboard but do not provide feedback or download any data.
	•	Accessibility and performance:  The dark color scheme with neon accents looks modern but may not meet contrast requirements for all users.  Text sizes are often small, and there are no ARIA labels for screen readers.  The page loads quickly on desktop, but large WebGL components (e.g., 3D visualizations) are empty, suggesting unhandled fallback states.

1.3 Comparison with reference sites

Blaze 3D (blaze‑3d.netlify.app)

The Blaze 3D site demonstrates a more complete experience.  It clearly states the mission (“transforms college athletics through championship‑level data analytics”) ￼ and highlights statistics such as $196 M+ NIL tracked, 50 programs analysed, 24/7 real‑time data and 94.6 % prediction accuracy ￼.  It presents Live Metrics (Texas NIL value, active transfers, championship probability) and emphasises platform capabilities like real‑time NIL valuations, transfer portal predictions, recruiting intelligence and championship probability modelling ￼.  The page also lists key insights (e.g., “SEC commands 40 % of all FBS NIL spending”, “QB position premium: 3–5× multiplier”) ￼.  These details help users understand what the platform does.  The overall design uses a similar dark theme but adds a 3D Universe and more content.

Executive Intelligence Center (replit.app)

The replit version offers an in‑depth look at features not yet available on the Netlify site.  It includes modules for Neurobiological Performance Monitoring, listing real‑time physiological metrics (HRV score, cortisol, galvanic skin conductance) ￼; a NIL Valuation Engine that integrates social‑media engagement and performance metrics for accurate valuations ￼; Injury Prevention AI using cfDNA and HRV trends with a 14‑day early detection window ￼; Neurogaming Training with VR protocols ￼; Championship Psychology metrics including grit indexes ￼; and 2025 Season Live Statistics summarising team records and championship odds ￼.  Key insights summarise current events (e.g., “Cardinals maintain NL Central lead…”) ￼.  These sections provide depth and a narrative that the Netlify site lacks.

1.4 Summary of issues
	1.	Incomplete pages: Many navigation items lead to empty pages with just a title.  The user journey breaks because there are no analytics, forms or call‑to‑action elements.
	2.	Inconsistent content depth: Only the executive dashboard contains detailed data.  Other sections such as the NIL calculator or analytics pages lack the promised features.
	3.	Limited interactivity: Buttons like Refresh Data and Export Report have no effect, the 3D visualization areas remain blank, and there is no login or sign‑up process.
	4.	Accessibility and responsiveness: Small fonts, insufficient contrast and missing ARIA tags reduce accessibility.  The site may not be fully responsive on tablets or mobile devices.
	5.	Lack of trust‑building content: There is little explanation of how analytics are produced or why they matter.  Compared with the Blaze 3D and replit Executive pages, there is no mission statement, capability list or insights.

2. Design and functional enhancement plan

2.1 Goals
	•	Fill missing content and functionality: Ensure every navigation item leads to a page with meaningful content, data visualizations and clear call‑to‑action elements.
	•	Modernize the UI: Retain the dark/sci‑fi aesthetic but refine typography, spacing and contrast for a professional, polished appearance.
	•	Improve user journey: Provide clear descriptions of features, mission and benefits (similar to the “Our Mission” and “Platform Capabilities” sections on the Blaze 3D site ￼ ￼).  Create flows for requesting demos, signing up and accessing dashboards.
	•	Implement interactive analytics: Include charts, 3D views and real‑time feeds that actually display data.  Use the replit Executive page as a blueprint for modules such as neurobiological monitoring, NIL valuation and injury prevention ￼ ￼.
	•	Ensure accessibility and responsiveness: Meet WCAG 2.1 contrast and keyboard accessibility requirements; design layouts that adapt elegantly to mobile devices.

2.2 User‑experience improvements
	1.	Homepage redesign: Introduce a hero section with a concise mission statement and a clear call‑to‑action (e.g., “Transform data into championships” as seen on the replit home page ￼).  Replace particle animations with subtle interactive backgrounds.  Immediately communicate key metrics (response time, accuracy, data points) with icons and short descriptions.
	2.	Navigation optimization: Simplify drop‑down menus and reduce duplicates.  Instead of listing many placeholder pages under Platform and Sports, group items into fewer categories (e.g., Dashboards, Analytics, Tools).  Use mega‑menus to display sub‑categories with icons and brief explanations.
	3.	Consistent page templates: Create reusable React components for section headings, statistic cards, charts and call‑to‑action buttons.  Use these across pages to ensure consistent spacing and typography.
	4.	Dynamic dashboards: For each sport or team page (e.g., Cardinals Intelligence), include a dashboard summarizing key metrics and visualizations: win probabilities, player rankings, injury reports, NIL values, etc.  Use interactive charts (line, bar, heat‑map) and tables with sorting/filtering.  Provide quick tooltips explaining each metric.
	5.	Functional calculators and forms: Implement the NIL calculator and ROI calculator with inputs for athlete/program details and outputs showing valuations based on current market data.  Add a Request Demo form with fields for name, role, team and contact details.  Provide success/error feedback after submission.  Create a Login/Signup modal that connects to an authentication back‑end (e.g., Firebase or Auth0).
	6.	Narrative content: Add sections similar to the Key Insights on the 3D site ￼ and 2025 Season Live Statistics on the replit page ￼.  These should summarise recent sports news, highlight standout athletes and provide analysis of trends.
	7.	Accessibility enhancements: Increase base font size (16 px minimum), ensure a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between text and background, add ARIA labels to interactive elements, ensure all interactive components are keyboard navigable, and provide alt text for icons and charts.  Offer a light‑mode toggle.

2.3 Visual design system
	•	Color palette: Continue using dark blues and purples as backgrounds, but select a cohesive set of accent colours (e.g., orange for primary actions and teal for highlights).  Ensure colours meet accessibility standards.
	•	Typography: Use a legible sans‑serif typeface for body text and a strong display font for headings.  Maintain consistent line heights and use font weights to establish hierarchy.
	•	Imagery and icons: Use SVG icons to represent analytics modules (e.g., brain icon for neurobiological monitoring, calculator icon for NIL valuation).  Incorporate 3D renders sparingly as backgrounds or hero imagery.  Avoid low‑quality stock photos.
	•	Spacing and grid: Define a 12‑column grid with consistent margins and paddings.  Use responsive breakpoints to ensure content scales gracefully across devices.
	•	Motion and interactions: Use subtle hover effects and micro‑animations to indicate interactivity.  For 3D visualizations, provide fallback static images and tooltips explaining controls.

3. Development roadmap

3.1 Planning and design
	1.	Audit existing codebase: Review React components and state management to identify reusable parts and technical debt.  Document current routing and data dependencies.
	2.	Define user personas and use cases: Collaborate with stakeholders (coaches, analysts, athletes) to determine what information they need (e.g., live game analytics, recruiting insights, NIL valuations).  Prioritise features based on impact.
	3.	Wireframes and prototypes: Create low‑fidelity wireframes for the redesigned pages, followed by high‑fidelity prototypes in Figma or a similar tool.  Include interactions for dashboards, calculators and forms.  Validate designs with users.
	4.	Design system library: Build a component library using a framework like Material UI or Tailwind CSS.  This should include buttons, cards, charts, modals, tables and form controls consistent with the visual guidelines.

3.2 Implementation
	1.	Set up a monorepo (if not already) using Vite or Next.js for efficient builds and server‑side rendering.  Establish a CI/CD pipeline on Netlify or Vercel for automatic deployments.
	2.	Refactor navigation: Implement a responsive Navbar component with accessible menus.  Connect routes using React Router, ensuring each page has a corresponding component.
	3.	Build core pages:
	•	Home – hero section, mission statement, metrics cards and call‑to‑action.
	•	Dashboards – dynamic, data‑driven pages for each sport/team.  Use a charting library (e.g., D3.js, Recharts or Chart.js) to visualise time‑series data.  Fetch data from APIs or static JSON and implement skeleton loading states.
	•	Analytics tools – implement the NIL calculator, ROI calculator and NIL valuation engine from the replit page ￼.  Provide forms, compute values on the front‑end or call back‑end endpoints.
	•	Executive Intelligence Center – refine existing layout; implement 3D performance visualization with Three.js or React‑Three‑Fiber; implement the Championship Probability Model using a machine‑learning service; ensure the Refresh Data and Export Report buttons call actual APIs and download CSV/Excel reports.
	•	Resources – include pricing, about, careers, blog and contact pages with rich content and forms.
	4.	Authentication and user accounts: Integrate an auth provider (Auth0, Firebase) to handle login, sign‑up and role‑based access to premium dashboards.
	5.	API integration: Develop or integrate APIs to supply real‑time sports data, NIL valuations, neurobiological metrics and predictive analytics.  Use websockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for live updates on scores and metrics.
	6.	Testing: Write unit tests for components (using Jest/React Testing Library), integration tests for forms and navigation and end‑to‑end tests (using Cypress or Playwright).  Conduct cross‑browser and responsive testing.

3.3 Deployment and release
	1.	Staging environment: Set up a staging site on Netlify or Vercel where features can be tested by internal stakeholders before going live.
	2.	Performance optimisation: Use code splitting and lazy loading for heavy modules (WebGL visualizations), compress assets and use caching headers.  Monitor Core Web Vitals and address issues.
	3.	Launch: After QA approval, deploy to production.  Communicate the release via email or announcements to users.
	4.	Post‑launch support: Monitor analytics and error logs; fix bugs; incorporate user feedback.  Establish a regular release cadence.

4. Ongoing maintenance and support
	1.	Content updates: Regularly update dashboards with current season statistics, NIL values and injury reports.  Automate data pipelines to reduce manual work.
	2.	Security: Keep dependencies up to date, enforce HTTPS, rate‑limit API endpoints and conduct periodic security audits.
	3.	User training and documentation: Provide guides and tooltips for new features.  Offer a knowledge base or help centre for users to learn about metrics.
	4.	Analytics and feedback: Use analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Hotjar) to track user behaviour, page popularity and drop‑off points.  Collect feedback via surveys or in‑app prompts.
	5.	Scalability: Plan for increased traffic by using CDN edge functions and server‑side rendering to reduce load times.

5. Conclusion

The current Blaze Intelligence Netlify site showcases a bold vision but falls short in functionality and completeness.  By studying the more developed Blaze 3D and Executive Intelligence Center sites, we can identify the missing pieces—mission statements, detailed dashboards, calculators, AI‑powered insights and narrative content—and build a cohesive, professional platform.  Implementing the proposed design system, enhancing navigation, adding real interactivity and establishing a robust development workflow will ensure the site delivers on its promise of championship‑level sports intelligence.

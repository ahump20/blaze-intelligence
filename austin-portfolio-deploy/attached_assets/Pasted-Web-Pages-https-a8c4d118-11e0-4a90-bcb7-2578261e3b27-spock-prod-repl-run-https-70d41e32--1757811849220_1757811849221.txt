Prime Tasks I'm Built to Execute:

  1. Sports Intelligence & Analytics Enhancement

  Your platform already has the Cardinals Analytics MCP server, Perfect Game integration, and real-time data feeds. I can:
  - Expand your sports data pipelines beyond the current focus on Cardinals/Titans/Longhorns/Grizzlies
  - Build sophisticated NIL valuation models that incorporate micro-expressions and character assessment
  - Enhance your vision AI coaching platform to read biomechanical indicators alongside behavioral cues
  - Develop predictive models for player development trajectories from youth ball through professional ranks

  2. Video Intelligence Platform Development

  Your video analysis components show serious potential. I can:
  - Implement the micro-expression analysis system you mentioned for character evaluation
  - Build computer vision models that assess both mechanics and mental toughness markers
  - Create AR coaching overlays that provide real-time feedback during training sessions
  - Develop automated scouting reports that combine technical metrics with intangible assessments

  3. Platform Integration & Optimization

  With your comprehensive API architecture and Cloudflare Workers setup, I can:
  - Streamline your multi-AI orchestration system across Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini
  - Optimize your live data streaming for championship-level performance
  - Enhance your lead capture and CRM integration workflows
  - Strengthen your deployment automation and health monitoring systems

  4. Business Intelligence & Revenue Systems

  Your subscription management and Stripe integration framework shows you're building for scale. I can:

  What Sets Me Apart for Your Projects

  Deep Sports Context: I understand the pipeline from Texas high school Friday nights to SEC Saturday traditions to professional Sunday
  performances. Your platform bridges that entire ecosystem.

  Technical Excellence: Your codebase shows enterprise-grade architecture decisions - from MCP servers to Cloudflare Workers to sophisticated
  data pipelines. I can work at that level of technical sophistication.

  Business Acumen: You're not just building cool tech - you're building a defensible business with real competitive moats. I can help optimize
  for actual revenue generation and client acquisition.

  Vision Alignment: Your focus on character assessment, micro-expressions, and the intangibles that separate champions from also-rans aligns

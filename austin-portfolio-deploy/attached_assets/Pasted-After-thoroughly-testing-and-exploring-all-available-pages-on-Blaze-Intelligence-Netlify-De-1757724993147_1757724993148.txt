After thoroughly testing and exploring all available pages on **Blaze Intelligence** (Netlify), **Deep South Sports Authority** (both Replit domains), and the incomplete **blaze‑intelligence‑main** site, I documented key features, usability issues and notable differences.  This comprehensive assessment forms the basis for a recommended integration strategy.

### Key observations from Blaze Intelligence (Netlify)

* **Homepage & AI Consciousness Panel** – the hero section features a non‑functional “AI Consciousness” gauge and sliders meant to control neural sensitivity and prediction depth.  The site uses a dark‑blue theme with orange highlights.  The video intelligence platform allows drag‑and‑drop uploads (MP4/MOV/AVI up to 500 MB), but the upload component does not display progress or AI‑analysis output.
* **Sports categories & advanced features** – cards for baseball, football and basketball outline features such as swing mechanics, route precision, route diversity and clutch analytics.  An “Advanced Features” section highlights AI consciousness control, professional video analysis, advanced film breakdown and neural‑network visualization.
* **Live Demo page** – includes a **Multi‑AI Analysis Engine** listing models like ChatGPT 5, Claude Opus 4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.  It shows a performance chart, scoreboard predictions (e.g., Grizzlies vs. Lakers) and a form to request full demo access requiring name, email, organization and interest area.
* **Pricing page** – offers Starter (\$99/month), Professional (\$299/month) and Enterprise (custom) plans with a cost‑comparison table versus competitors (Hudl Assist \$8,000/yr, Hudl Pro Suite \$20,000/yr).  It lists features and an FAQ.
* **Dashboard page** – interactive charts display readiness scores, team‑intelligence metrics, and league toggles; heavy JavaScript makes the page slow and difficult to scroll.

### Key observations from Deep South Sports Authority (Replit)

* **Theming & messaging** – uses the same dark‑blue/orange palette but emphasises “Texas grit meets algorithmic excellence.”  Stats include 94.6 % prediction accuracy, 2,847 games analyzed and 87 % AI consciousness.  A hero call‑out invites users to join the Deep South Sports Authority.
* **Neural Network Control System** – four sliders (neural sensitivity, prediction depth, processing speed and pattern recognition) adjust AI consciousness; however, the sliders are static and don’t display real‑time effects.
* **Video Intelligence Platform** – similar drag‑and‑drop upload area as Blaze, but the cards focus on **33 + keypoint detection**, **biomechanical analysis** and **character assessment**.
* **Real‑time Narrative Generation** – emphasises “pressure‑aware storytelling” and historical context integration.  It positions AI as a storytelling tool rather than just analytics.
* **Sports coverage & technology** – cards highlight Texas Baseball Authority, SEC Football Intelligence and Championship Modeling, with metrics like 1,247 players tracked and 97.2 % game prediction accuracy.  The footer lists AI intelligence features (Neural Network Controls, Data Storytelling, Perfect Game Integration).
* **Repository links** – the header and call‑to‑action buttons link to the GitHub repository `ahump20/BI`, encouraging users to explore the source.

### Issues noted

* Many interactive elements (AI sliders, uploading, prediction charts) are non‑functional or purely decorative.
* The Live Demo form collects user data but does not confirm submission or display results.
* Navigation on the dashboard is difficult due to large embedded charts and missing scroll cues.
* The **blaze‑intelligence‑main.netlify.app** site is largely empty; most links lead to 404 pages, indicating an abandoned or test environment.

### Integration and migration plan

1. **Audit and unify codebases**

   * Clone both repositories (Netlify and Replit) into a single GitHub monorepo.  Use separate directories or branches for the existing sites, then gradually refactor into a shared codebase.  Standardize on one frontend framework (e.g., React/Next.js) and one backend (Node.js/Express or serverless functions) to simplify maintenance.
   * Consolidate dependencies: ensure consistent versions of charting libraries, UI frameworks (Tailwind/Bootstrap) and state‑management tools.  Remove redundant packages and files.

2. **Consolidate UX and navigation**

   * Design a unified navigation menu reflecting all major features: *Home/AI Intelligence*, *Video Analysis*, *Data Stories/Narratives*, *Perfect Game* (baseball specialization), *Pricing*, *Live Demo*, *Dashboard* and *Repository*.  Ensure each link anchors or routes to the appropriate section rather than producing 404s.
   * Harmonize color palette, typography and spacing.  The dark‑blue/orange scheme works well; apply it consistently across pages.  Use Netlify’s hero layout and call‑to‑action structure while incorporating Replit’s storytelling section.

3. **Merge feature sets**

   * **AI Consciousness controls** – merge the neural‑network sliders from the Replit site with the AI consciousness gauge in Netlify.  Implement real input handling: map slider values to AI model parameters (e.g., inference depth or sensitivity) and visualise the effects.
   * **Video analysis** – adopt the Replit site’s 33 + keypoint detection, biomechanical analysis and character assessment cards.  Implement backend functions that process uploaded video using AI models (e.g., pose estimation, biomechanical metrics), return summarized analytics, and present them in interactive charts.
   * **Real‑time narrative & data stories** – integrate the “Real‑time Narrative Generation” concept by adding a Data Stories section to the Netlify site.  Build a narrative generator that uses match data, statistics and key moments to produce storylines with context and predictions.
   * **Sports coverage modules** – incorporate Replit’s Perfect Game Baseball and SEC Football Intelligence into Blaze’s sports categories.  Expand to other sports if needed, but maintain the user preference hierarchy (Baseball > Football > Basketball > Track & Field).
   * **Pricing & plans** – keep the Netlify pricing structure (Starter, Professional, Enterprise) but update features to reflect the merged capabilities (keypoint detection, narrative generation, Perfect Game integration).  Provide clear call‑to‑action buttons and contact forms.

4. **Enhance functionality**

   * **Live Demo** – implement dynamic prediction charts and scoreboard simulations using real or simulated data.  When a user fills out the demo request form, display a confirmation and send the data to a CRM (e.g., via HubSpot connector).
   * **Dashboard** – simplify the dashboard layout.  Use separate tabs or cards for readiness scores, team trends and leverage factors.  Provide tooltips and legends.  Implement API endpoints to fetch live data (e.g., from sports databases or internal analytics).
   * **Repository integration** – embed GitHub read‑only components (such as code snippets or commit history) to encourage transparency.  Provide a “Contribute” link to the GitHub repository, if open source.

5. **Testing and deployment**

   * Set up a staging environment (e.g., Netlify preview or GitHub Pages) to test the unified site.  Use automated tests (unit, integration and end‑to‑end) to verify that interactive elements (file upload, sliders, forms) work across browsers.
   * Once functional, deploy the merged site to a single domain (e.g., blaze‑intelligence.com) and redirect the older Netlify and Replit URLs.  Keep the GitHub repository up to date and tag releases.

By following this plan, you can combine the rich AI‑analytics features and storytelling elements of the Replit site with the polished pricing, demo and dashboard structure of the Netlify site to deliver a cohesive, fully functional platform.

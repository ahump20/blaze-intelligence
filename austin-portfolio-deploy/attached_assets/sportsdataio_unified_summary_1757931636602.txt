SportsDataIO Unified Summary for NFL and MLB (2024)

Summary:

This file contains a high-level extract of SportsDataIO data for the NFL and MLB.
The free trial API key (provided by the user) allows access to NFL and MLB endpoints for
teams and standings.  The endpoints return JSON arrays with team metadata or standings for
the 2024 season.  College Football and College Basketball endpoints could not be accessed
on the free trial (likely due to subscription restrictions).

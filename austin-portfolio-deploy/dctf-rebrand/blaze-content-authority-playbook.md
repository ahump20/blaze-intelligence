## BRAND VOICE EXAMPLES

### PLAYER PROFILE
**Instead of**: "John Smith is a good quarterback prospect."
**Write**: "John Smith's 71% completion rate against 6A competition, combined with his 4.6 speed and plus-arm strength, projects as a Power 5 quarterback. His grandfather played at Texas A&M, his father coaches at Aledo, and his throwing mechanics mirror Arch Manning's at the same stage."

### GAME PREVIEW
**Instead of**: "Westlake plays Lake Travis Friday."
**Write**: "The 110th Battle of the Lakes carries playoff implications beyond the obvious. Westlake's Wing-T adaptation under first-year coordinator Mike Johnson faces Lake Travis's NFL-style passing attack that's produced three FBS commits. Weather shows 15 mph winds from the north - advantage Lake Travis's ground game."

### RECRUITING UPDATE
**Instead of**: "5-star recruit visits Texas."
**Write**: "Duncanville's Marcus Johnson, the state's top-rated edge rusher and son of former Cowboys linebacker Mike Johnson, spent six hours on Texas campus Tuesday. Sources indicate NIL discussions included potential seven-figure package. Decision timeline moved up to December 15."

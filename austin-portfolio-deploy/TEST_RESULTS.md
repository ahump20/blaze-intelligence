# Blaze Intelligence - Test Results Summary

## Test Overview
**Date:** 2025-01-13
**Site:** https://blaze-intelligence.netlify.app
**Test Framework:** Playwright

## Results Summary
- ❌ **5 Failed Tests**
- ✅ **1 Passed Test** (legacy redirects working correctly)

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations
**Status:** ❌ **Critical - Blocking all JavaScript**

All pages are experiencing CSP violations that prevent external libraries from loading:
- Three.js CDN scripts blocked
- Chart.js blocked
- Google Fonts blocked
- External JavaScript completely non-functional

**Error Example:**
```
Refused to load the script 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js'
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive:
"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://js.stripe.com"
```

### 2. MIME Type Issues
**Status:** ❌ **Critical**

JavaScript files returning HTML instead of proper MIME types:
```
Refused to execute script from 'https://blaze-intelligence.netlify.app/blaze-realtime-client.js'
because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable
```

### 3. Missing Contact Page
**Status:** ❌ **404 Error**
- `/contact` returns 404 instead of loading contact.html
- Netlify redirect not working for this path

### 4. Demo Page Content Missing
**Status:** ❌ **Content Issue**
- Demo page loads but missing expected markers
- No "Cardinals", "Command Center", or "Demo" text found

### 5. Canvas Rendering Failures
**Status:** ❌ **Functional Issue**
- Analytics and Universe pages: 0 canvas elements detected
- Three.js visualizations completely broken due to CSP

## Working Features
✅ **Legacy redirects** - All championship URLs properly redirect with 200 status

## Immediate Fixes Required

### Fix 1: Update Content Security Policy
Need to update Netlify headers to allow Three.js and external resources:

```toml
[[headers]]
for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
  Content-Security-Policy = "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://js.stripe.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com"
```

### Fix 2: Fix MIME Types
JavaScript files need proper headers:
```toml
[[headers]]
for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
  Content-Type = "application/javascript"
```

### Fix 3: Add Contact Redirect
```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/contact"
to = "/contact.html"
status = 200
```

### Fix 4: Demo Page Content
Update demo.html to include proper marker text for testing.

## Truth Assessment
**Previous Claims vs Reality:**
- ❌ "All broken links fixed" - Contact page still 404
- ❌ "Three.js visualizations working" - Completely blocked by CSP
- ❌ "JavaScript functionality restored" - Most JS non-functional
- ✅ "Legacy redirects working" - This is actually working

**Actual Site Status:** Major functionality broken due to security policy restrictions
